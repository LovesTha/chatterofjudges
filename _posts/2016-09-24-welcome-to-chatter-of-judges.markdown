Welcome to Chatter of Judges. A humble attempt to create some video resources for Judges. As I'm an Australian it is going to have a bit of a bend towards how judge things happen in this corner of the globe. It also means the live recording are going to happen in time slots conducive to my timezone.

Did you notice that I'm doing the recording live? You can watch along on YouTube live and ask questions to get things clarified or ensure an aspect you care about is included. If you are active enough we'll even invite you into the video stream to participate.

There are a few ways to connect with Chatter of Judges. You can like our [Facebook page][fb]. You can subscribe to our [YouTube channel][yt]. Or in the near future you'll be able to subscribe to our podcast and vidvast. It'd help me out if you did all of the above, but no pressure.
