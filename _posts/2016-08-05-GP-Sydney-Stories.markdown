Just a quick episode this time, and all by my self. (at least on the video, there were some people in the chat helping out.) First I discuss GP food then talk about the sheet of lands method for organising ODE's (spoiler: I love it).

Secondly I talk about and reflect on what the 2017 schedule for GPs in Australia is.
